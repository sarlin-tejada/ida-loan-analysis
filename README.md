## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop
- MySQL Workbench

### 1. Clone and configure

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <project-folder>
.\scripts\setup.ps1
```

The setup script will prompt you for project name, database name, passwords, and port — and write your `.env` automatically.

### 2. Start the database

```bash
docker-compose up -d
docker ps   # confirm container is running
```

### 3. Create tables and analyst user

Open MySQL Workbench and create a new connection:
- Host: `127.0.0.1`
- Port: as set in `.env`
- User: `root`
- Password: as set during setup

Verify the database exists:
- Expand the schema panel and confirm `<database_name>` appears

Then run in order:
1. Open and execute `sql/schema/01_create_tables.sql`
2. Verify the table was created — refresh schemas and confirm table appears
3. Open and execute `sql/schema/02_create_analyst_user.sql`
4. Verify analyst user — run `SELECT user, host FROM mysql.user WHERE user = 'analyst';`

### 4. Add raw data

See [`docs/data_sources.md`](docs/data_sources.md) for download instructions.

Place files in `data/raw/`.

### 5. Import data

Update the file path in `sql/schema/03_import_data.sql` to match your local `data/raw/` directory.

Open and execute `sql/schema/03_import_data.sql` in Workbench as root.

Verify the import:
- Run `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <table_name>;` and confirm row count matches expected total.

Note: If import returns 0 rows, check `LINES TERMINATED BY` in the script — try `'\r\n'` if `'\n'` doesn't work.

### 6. Create a new connection using analyst credentials

Open MySQL Workbench and create a new connection:
- Host: `127.0.0.1`
- Port: as set in `.env`
- User: `analyst`
- Password: as set during setup
